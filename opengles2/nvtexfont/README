NvTexFont is an OpenGLES implementation of this library, ported first to
GLES1 and from there to GLES2. (The GLES1 version is no longer provided.)

The following modifications were made:

1. Conversion from Begin/End to vertex arrays.  A little more involved
   than you might think.

   The st coordinates for the entire font are now kept in txf->st and
   vertex coordinates are in txf->vert.  This allowed TexGlyphVertexInfo
   to be eliminated entirely.  The txf->lut now holds the indicies into
   the TexGlyphInfo array, and getGlyphIndex is used to get the index of
   a particular character.

   TexFontRenderGlyph is no longer a public function.  This means the
   enabling of GL_VERTEX_ARRAY and GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY client state,
   as well as setting the VertexPointer and TexCoordPointer, needs to be
   done once per TexFrontRenderString call instead of once per
   TexFontRenderGlyph.

2. Some embedded platforms lack File IO, so the binary texFont files
   were converted to C headers (one for each font) and are built into
   the library.  By default, only the default font is built in, and
   others can be added from the Makefile (via -DUSE_HAEBERLI_FONT, for
   example).  All calls to fread(..., file) were replaced with the
   similar-looking BUFREAD(..., buffer).

3. The supplied "default.txf" was missing the '-' character.  An attempt
   to add it failed, since the particular Courier font used in the
   sample gentexfont.c did not come close to fitting in 256x256.

   I made helvetica.txf from
   -adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--34-*-100-100-*-*-iso8859-1 and it is
   now the default for NVTexFont.

4. All characters satisfying isprint(...) were added to helvetica font.
   Support for other raster fonts was removed.

5. Separate versions of the functions are provided which render using
   vectors rather than rasters.
